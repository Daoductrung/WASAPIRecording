We have made the mensajes.pot file available so you can generate new translations for the WASAPIRecording application.
You can send us the .po and .mo files with your translations via email to xebolax@gmail.com, including "WASAPIRecording Application" in the subject line.
You can also send the translations via Mastodon by messaging @HXeBoLaX@comunidad.nvda.es.
Warning: In languages other than Spanish, keyboard shortcuts may not match those described in the documentation. This is due to automated translation. To address this, the app.po files for each language are provided, in case someone wishes to modify the keyboard shortcuts. Any modifications can also be sent to us through the aforementioned channels.
Thank you for helping make this application more accessible for all users!
